This client re-use is completely transparent to the user.</p> <p>Finally, Open Banking Connector allows the external (bank) ID of an existing OAuth2 client created externally to be passed in using the <code>ExternalApiId</code> property.

Also performing DCR twice for the same bank might, depending on bank behaviour, result in re-generating the previous OAuth2 client (with same ID). For at least one bank, though, using the same client for both AISP and PISP is not allowed. Open Banking Connector has an internal concept of bank registration groups.

Supporting end-user auth with real banks requires creating a suitable app - see here for more info.</p> <p>To start manual end-user auth (suitable for sandboxes), copy the auth URL into a browser and go through the bank's authorisation process.</p> <p>When this is complete you will be redirected back to your redirect URL, which by default will be the default fragment ( or query) redirect URL from the software statement specified when creating the consent's bank registration. The bank redirect data will be included in the fragment (or query) of the URL. Even if no web page exists at the URL, you can still copy the URL fragment (or query) from your browser to capture the bank redirect data.</p> <p>To complete end-user auth, pass to Open Banking Connector the bank redirect data supplied by the bank in the fragment ( or query) of the redirect URL. This needs to be done within 10 minutes of auth context creation or you will need to create a new auth context and attempt auth again.</p> <p>Upon receipt and successful validation of the bank redirect data, Open Banking Connector will obtain tokens for the consent in preparation for future requests.</p>"},{"location":"get-started/run-container/","title":"Run the Open Banking Connector container","text":"<p>Once you have set up basic configuration, you are ready to run the Open Banking Connector Docker container.</p> <p>Open Banking Connector Docker images are available here.

This will remain valid for 10 minutes. If for any reason auth fails or too much time elapses, please create a new auth context before re-attempting auth. For an AISP consent, you can create an auth context using the POST /aisp/account-access-consent-auth-contexts endpoint. Upon creating an auth context, Open Banking Connector will return an auth URL you can redirect the user to. This URL should be used within 5 minutes to avoid signed object expiry.</p> <p>After end-user auth, the bank will redirect to a secure URL your app provides (the redirect URL can be selected from those in your software statement assertion (SSA) when creating a bank registration). This URL should display appropriate customer messaging and process the bank redirect data in the URL fragment (or query). This redirect data needs to be forwarded by your back-end to Open Banking Connector via the POST /auth/redirect-delegate endpoint.
